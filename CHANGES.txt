  - Now "get_resources" is an iterator that returns a resource (not a name)
    at a time.
  - Memory folders provide "get_atime".

  Handlers
  - Add the methods "get_handler_names", "get_handlers" and "has_handler".
  - The methods "get_resource", "has_resource", "set_resource", etc. have
    been removed. Access them throug the "resource" attribute, or use the
    equivalent handler methods ("get_handler_names", etc).
  - Now text handlers only must define the method "to_unicode", which now
    accepts the optional parameter encoding.
  - The methods "__str__" and "__unicode__" have been removed. Use instead
    "to_str" and "to_unicode".
  - Serialization and de-serialization code has been moved from "xml.Schema"
    to "handlers.IO". Now the code serializes and de-serializes to and from
    byte strings.

  XML
  - The architecture has been cleaned and simplified, specially for attributes,
    whose API has changed.
  - The new method "traverse2" makes "walk" obsolete.

  Simple Template Language
  - The "stl:if" and "stl:attributes" expressions accept the new "not"
    operator. This change makes the "stl:ifnot" statement obsolete.

  Catalog
  - Now the catalog follows the load/save logic. As a side effect the index
    and unindex operation has been speeded up but a factor of 2, aproximately.

  Workflow
  - Remove the "__init__" method from the "WorkflowAware" class to avoid
    conflicts with handler classes. Now the method "enter_workflow" must
    be called explicitly.

  Documentation
  - Re-write part of the introduction.
  - Re-organize the handler chapters. Explain some things for the first time,
    explain other things better.
