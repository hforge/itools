itools 0.20.0 (2007/12/20)
==========================

itools is a Python library, it groups a number of packages into a single
meta-package for easier development and deployment:

  itools.catalog          itools.i18n             itools.uri
  itools.csv              itools.ical             itools.vfs
  itools.datatypes        itools.odf              itools.web
  itools.gettext          itools.pdf              itools.workflow
  itools.git              itools.rest             itools.xliff
  itools.handlers         itools.rss              itools.xml
  itools.html             itools.stl
  itools.http             itools.tmx

The most visible change in this major release is that "itools.cms" has
been moved out of itools and is now distributed as a separate package,
named "ikaaro".  Also in the code reorganization category: "itools.xhtml"
has been merged into "itools.html".

The most important change is the architecture overhaul of the "handlers"
package.  From a functional point of view, the big news is the database
layer that has been included, which provides atomic transactions for the
file system.  But the changes go well beyond that, read the documentation
to learn how things work now.

Other packages that have seen more or less important API improvements
or changes include "itools.catalog", "itools.csv", "itools.datatypes",
"itools.rss", "itools.vfs" and "itools.web".  There have been also many
naming normalizations.  Check the upgrade notes for further details.

The numbering scheme has changed, we have jumped from the 0.16 to the
0.20 version, and future major releases will be numbered 0.30, 0.40,
0.50, etc.  (This change is to define an implicit releationship with
the numbering scheme of "ikaaro".)
