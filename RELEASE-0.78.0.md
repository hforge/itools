## Itools 0.78.0 - 2019/02/08

Itools 0.78.0 is a transitional version.
We've:
 - removed unused and unmaintained code to simplify migration to python3.
 - removed `C` server to avoid complex migration to python3.
 - removed `itools.vfs` to avoid complex dependency with GIO
 - fixed various bugs

The purpose is to prepare future:

 - Migration to python3
 - Increase performances of database
 - Possibility to add an SQL backend (posgres json for example ?)
 - Allow to handle several requests at once on ikaaro webserver
 - Simplify build of javascript web applications with ikaaro

Lot of works remains to be cleaned...
In 0.78 we'll try to make non breaking changes. (or small ones).
