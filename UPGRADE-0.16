**************************************************************************
itools 0.16.0
**************************************************************************

1. Import changes
=================

The API has been flatten. All functions, constants, classes and exceptions
of a package are available at the package's root level (no need to go search
a function in some module). Only exception is "itools.cms", which is too big
to have a flat API.

Also, all modules are now in lowercase.

These and other minor changes in the organization of the code, made it
necessary to modify some import statements. Some examples:

  from itools.catalog.queries import Equal, Phrase         # Before
  from itools.catalog import EqQuery, PhraseQuery          # Now

  from itools.xml.parser import Parser, START_ELEMENT
  from itools.xml import Parser, START_ELEMENT, END

  from itools.cms.utils import checkid
  from itools.rest import checkid

  from itools.cms.Handler import Handler
  from itools.cms.base import Handler

  from itools.cms.Folder import Folder
  from itools.cms.folder import Folder

  from itools.cms.WebSite import WebSite
  from itools.cms.website import WebSite

The list is not exhaustive, as it would be too large; you will have to
check the source code when an import fails.


2. itools.catalog
=================

The programming interface has changed notably. Check the documentation for
the complete details on how the new API works:

  http://download.ikaaro.org/doc/itools/index.html


2.1 The format has changed
--------------------------

The format of the catalog has changed again. This just means that existing
catalog instances must be rebuilt.


2.2 Creating a new catalog
--------------------------

The most important change is that the catalog is not anymore built around
the itools.handlers package, so its programming interface to create, load
and save the catalog has changed:

To Create a new catalog. Before:

  from itools.catalog import Catalog

  catalog = Catalog(fields=[
      ('name', 'keyword', True, True),
      ('text', 'text', True, False),
  ])
  catalog.save_state_to('catalog')
  catalog = Catalog('catalog')

Now:

  from itools.catalog import make_catalog, KeywordField, TextField

  catalog = make_catalog('catalog',
      KeywordField('name', is_stored=True)
      TextField('text'),
  )

As you can appreciate the definition of the fields to index has changed
too. This is meanly to allow the possibility to define custom fields.


2.3 Save the changes
--------------------

To save the changes made to the catalog, it is a bit different.

Before:

  catalog.save_state()

Now:

  catalog.commit()


2.4 Indexing and Unindexing
---------------------------

There are a couple of high level features that have been added to the
catalog, and that affect the way we index and unindex documents.

2.4.1 Indexing
..............

Now like before we can index a dictonary that contains a key/value pair
for every field.

But now indexing an object where the fields to be indexed are the object's
attributes does not work anymore.

If we want to index objects other than dictionaries we can use the higher
level CatalogAware class. Just inherit from CatalogAware and define a
method "get_catalog_indexes" that returns the dictionary that will finally
be indexed.


2.4.2 UnIndexing
................

The catalog has now the concept of "external id". When creating a new
catalog, the first field we define is the "external id". For example:

  catalog = make_catalog('catalog',
      KeywordField('name', is_stored=True)
      TextField('text'),
  )
 
Here the external id is the field "name". It is required that this field
to be indexed and stored, and that it uniquely identfies the document.

Now the method "unidex_catalog" expects the external id instead of the
internal id.

Before:

  for brain in catalog.search(name='toto').get_documents():
      catalog.unindex_document(brain.__number__)

Now:

  catalog.unindex_document('toto')


2.5 Queries
-----------

The queries are much the same, but they have been renamed to append the
prefix "Query". This is part of the work to flat the API.

Before:

  from itools.catalog.queries import Equal, Phrase, Range, And, Or

Now:

  from itools.catalog import (EqQuery, PhraseQuery, RangeQuery, AndQuery,
      OrQuery)



3. itools.xml
=============

3.1 Parser
----------

There have been some small changes to the parser programming interface.

The START_ELEMENT value is a three-items tuple, instead of four. The
namespaces are returned as simple attributes:

  # Before
  if event == START_ELEMENT:
      tag_uri, tag_name, attributes, ns_decls = value

  # NOW
  if event == START_ELEMENT:
      tag_uri, tag_name, attributes = value

Neither the text nodes nor the element attributes are deserialized now.
The parser always returns the values as byte strings in the source
encoding.


3.2 Documents
-------------

The state for XML document handlers is not anymore an element-tree, but
a sequence of events as they are returned by the XML parser.

This means existing code that manipulates the element-tree will need to
be updated to work with a list of events instead.


4. itools.cms
=============

4.1 Build Metadata
------------------

The method "build_metadata" has been moved from the container to the
sub-object. This is to say, a handler builds its own metadata.

Before:

  metadata = self.build_metadata(handler)

Now:

  metadata = handler.build_metadata()


4.2 Add and remove CMS objects
------------------------------

Two new methods, "set_object" and "del_object", are to be used when adding
and removing CMS objects; instead of the lower level handler methods
"set_handler" and "del_handler":

  handler = self.set_handler('name', handler)            # Before
  handler, metadata = self.set_object('name', handler)   # Now

  del_handler('name')
  del_object('name')


4.3 Definition of the catalog fields
------------------------------------

As we have seen earlier, the way to define the catalog fields has changed.

Before:

  class Root(...):
      _catalog_fields = [
          ('abspath', 'keyword', True, True),
          ('text', 'text, True, False),
          ...

Now:

  from itools.catalog import KeywordField, TextField

  class Root(...):
      _catalog_fields = [
          KeywordField('abspath', is_stored=True),
          TextField('text'),
          ...


4.4 Usage of the catalog
------------------------

The catalog is not anymore a handler, so the way to get it is different.
We do not need to get it anyway, better to use the Root's API.

Before:

  catalog = root.get_handler('.catalog')
  catalog.search(query)

Now:

  root.search(query)

Also, we will rarely need to reindex a handler by ourselves, since now the
methods "set_property" and "del_property" will automatically do it.

However, if we need to do it, the API has changed too:

Before:

  root.reindex_handler(handler)

Now:

  from itools.cms.catalog import schedule_to_reindex

  schedule_to_reindex(handler)
