itools.i18n
===========

The "accept" module has been rewritten.  As consequence there are several
API changes.

First: the "AcceptCharset" and "AcceptCharsetType" objects have been
removed.  The functionality they provided is not supported anymore. 

Second: the "AcceptLanguage" object is not exported through the public API.
Use instead "AcceptLanguageType" to build accept objects:

  AcceptLanguage(...)                       # Before
  AcceptLanguageType.decode(...)            # Now

Third (and last): accept objects do not provide the mapping interface
anymore, the public API is reduced to the methods: "set", "get_quality"
and "select_language".


itools.http / itools.web
========================

The request attributes "get_accept_language" and "accept_language" have
been removed.

Since request objects are most often used with the "itools.web" package,
the new context method "get_accept_language" can be used instead:

  context.request.accept_language           # Before
  context.get_accept_language()             # Now


itools.stl
==========

Now the method "stl" returns by default a stream of events (a generator).
The boolean parameter "html" has been replaced by "mode":

  stl(handler, namespace)                   # Before
  stl(handler, namespace, mode='html')      # Now

  stl(handler, namespace, html=False)       # Before
  stl(handler, namespace, mode='xhtml')     # Now

However, very often what you will actually want is the new default
behaviour.


itools.cms
==========

As a side effect of the changes in "itools.stl", skins that override the
"template" method will need an small change:

  stl(handler, namespace, prefix=prefix)                # Before
  stl(handler, namespace, prefix=prefix, mode='html')   # Now

Other than this, code will rarely need any other change.  Except maybe
in the skins logic.
