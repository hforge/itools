    """LRU stands for Least-Recently-Used.

    The LRUCache is a mapping from key to value, it is implemented as a dict
    with some differences:

    - The elements within the cache are ordered by the access time, starting
      from the least-recently used value.  All iteration methods ('items',
      'iteritems', 'keys', etc.) return the objects sorted by this criteria,
      and so does 'popitem' too.

    - The constructor is different from that of a dict, it expects first a
      'size_min' argument, and optionally a 'size_max' argument, they are
      used to control the dict size.

      Optionally it can take an 'automatic' boolean argument, which defaults
      to 'True'.

    - When the size of the cache surpasses the defined maximum size, then
      the least-recently used values from the cache will be removed, until its
      size reaches the defined minimum.

      This happens unless the 'automatic' parameter is set to 'False'. Then
      it will be the responsibility of external code to explicitly remove the
      least-recently used values.

    Some of the dict methods have been de-activated on purpose: 'copy',
    'fromkeys', 'setdefault' and 'update'.

    There are other new methods too:

    - touch(key): defines the value identified by the given key as to be
      accessed, hence it will be at the end of the list.
