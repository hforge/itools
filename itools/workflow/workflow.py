"""
The workflow module simplifies the task of writing workflow systems.

The development of a workflow system can be splitted in three steps:

 1. Define the workflow as a graph with the 'Workflow' class:

    1.1 Create an instance of the 'Workflow' class;

    1.2 Add to this instance the different states and optionally
        set the initial state;

    1.3 Add the transitions that let to go from one state to another.

 2. Define the objects that will follow the workflow:

    2.1 inherite from the 'WorkflowAware' class;

    2.2 introduce each object into the workflow with the 'enter_workflow'
        method.

 3. Associate the application semantics to the workflow aware objects
    by implementing the 'onenter', 'onleave' and 'ontrans' methods.

    Examples of "application semantics" are:

    - change the security settings of an object so it becomes public or
      private;

    - send an email to a user or a mailing list;

    """Mixin class to be used for workflow aware objects.

    The instances of a class that inherits from WorkflowAware can be
    "within" the workflow, this means that they keep track of the
    current state of the object.

    Specific application semantics for states and transitions can be
    implemented as methods of the WorkflowAware-derived "developer
    class". These methods get associated with the individual
    states and transitions by a simple naming scheme. For example,
    if a workflow has two states 'private' and 'public', and a
    transition 'publish' that goes from 'private' to 'public',
    the following happens when the transition is executed:

      1. if implemented, the method 'onleave_private' is called
         (it is called each time the object leaves the 'private' state)

      2. if implemented, the method 'ontrans_publish' is called
         (it is called whenever this transition is executed)

      3. if implemented, the method 'onenter_public' is called
         (it is called each time the object enters the 'public' state)

    These state/transition "handlers" can also be passed arguments
    from the caller of the transition; for instance, in a web-based
    system it might be useful to have the HTTP request that triggered
    the current transition available in the handlers.

    A simple stack with three methods, 'pushdata', 'popdata' adn 'getdata',
    is implemented. It can be used, for example, to keep record of the states
    the object has been in.
