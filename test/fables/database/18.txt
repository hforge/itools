The Bald Man and the Fly


There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot
summer's day.  A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate,
and stinging him from time to time.  The Man aimed a blow at his
little enemy, but acks palm came on his head instead;
again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and
said:

"You will only injure yourself if you
take notice of despicable enemies."
